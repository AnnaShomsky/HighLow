# HighLow
my GameJam2022 game
This game was written in Python. A random number is generated, and you need to guess it. Your goal is to get the lowest guess to possible numbers ratio. 
You can choose the range of numbers  to guess from by inputing a max value for the random number. You then guess a number, and the game tells you if your guess was too low or too high. Once you get the number, you see a graph representing the path you took to find the number. After playing 3 times, you get a graph showing your guess to possibility ratios, as well as your best, worst, and average ratios.
